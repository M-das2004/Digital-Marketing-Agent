# Digital-Marketing-Agent
Contextual Digital Marketing Agent with Google ADK

This project introduces a Multi-Agent System (MAS) for the autonomous design and deployment of comprehensive digital marketing campaigns, utilizing the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK) for execution and integration. The system comprises a network of nine specialized, interconnected agents that operate collaboratively to cover the entire campaign lifecycle. It begins with strategic analysis to define market and product positioning, transitions to audience and channel optimization by selecting targets and platforms, then performs creative generation to develop core concepts, messaging, and visual assets, and concludes with campaign synthesis, forecasting budget requirements and compiling all data and outputs into a final, ready-to-launch campaign blueprint. This intelligent architecture is designed to significantly reduce the time and resource expenditure traditionally associated with campaign development, providing a scalable and efficient solution for modern digital marketing practitioners.
